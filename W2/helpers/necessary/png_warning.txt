WARNING:

    If you want to use that file, you should install PyPNG library
    of version 0.0.17 or more. In Arch Linux it is available in
    AUR (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-pypng-git/), on
    other platforms if it is not available in standart repos, you
    can find it on https://github.com/drj11/pypng.

    Also this file uses sxiv image viewer (in Arch Linux it is
    available in standart repository) but if you want to use other
    image viewer, simply change a global constant "png_viewer" in
    the code.
